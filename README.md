# kCinema

kCinema is a movie store app. The app was built using react, react-redux, Axios, CSS, and external APIs.I used Axios to fetch remote API dates. The app enables users to filter our serious movies using a dropdown button. Users can search for any film by entering the movie title in the search box. Users can see the details of each movie.
